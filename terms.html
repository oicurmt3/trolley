            <li>You agree not to submit false or misleading reports deliberately.</li>
            <li>You grant us a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such User Content in connection with operating and promoting the Service.</li>

        </ul>

        <h2>5. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, including the ACL, in no event shall [Your Name/Organisation Name], nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from:</p>
