        <h1>Privacy Policy for Trolley Report</h1>
        <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong>12 April 2025</p>

        <p>This Privacy Policy outlines how https://sandgroper.net/trolley collects, uses, discloses, and manages personal information in connection with the Trolley Report application (the "Service"), in compliance with the Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) and the Australian Privacy Principles (APPs).</p>

        <h2>1. Collection of Personal Information (APP 3 & 5)</h2>
        <p>We collect information that you provide directly when you use the Service to report an abandoned trolley. The types of information collected include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Latitude and longitude coordinates provided by your device's GPS when you use the "Get Date/Time & Location" feature.</li>
            <li><strong>Timestamp Information:</strong> The date and time provided by your device when using the location feature, and the server-side timestamp (UTC) when the log is recorded.</li>
            <li><strong>Trolley Details:</strong> The trolley brand(s) and condition(s) you select.</li>
            <li><strong>User Comments:</strong> Any additional comments you voluntarily provide in the comments field. <span class="warning">We advise against including any personally identifiable information in the comments field.</span></li>
            <li><strong>Technical Information:</strong> Your IP address is automatically logged by the server when you submit a report for security and diagnostic purposes. We may also collect a client-side submission timestamp.</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies:</strong> We may use cookies solely for the purpose of limiting the number of submissions from a single browser within a specific time period to prevent abuse of the Service (see Section 7).</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Collection of location data requires your interaction with the "Get Date/Time & Location" button. Other information is collected upon submission of the report form.</p>
        <p><span class="warning">By using the Service and submitting a report, you consent to the collection of this information as described.</span></p>

        <h2>2. Use and Disclosure of Information (APP 6)</h2>
        <p>We use the collected information for the primary purposes of:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Operating and maintaining the Trolley Report Service.</li>
            <li>Recording the location and details of reported abandoned trolleys.</li>
            <li>Displaying the logged reports (including location, timestamp, brand(s), condition(s), and comments) publicly via the "See Logs" feature of the Service.</li>
            <li>Monitoring and preventing misuse or abuse of the Service (e.g., using IP addresses and submission timestamps).</li>
            <li>Troubleshooting and improving the Service.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="warning">Public Disclosure:</span> Please be aware that information submitted (excluding your IP address but including location, time, trolley details, and comments) is made publicly available through the "See Logs" page (view_logs.php). Do not submit any information you are not comfortable sharing publicly.</p>
        <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information to third parties. We will not disclose your IP address publicly, except where required by law or for legitimate security investigations.</p>
        <p>We may use aggregated, anonymized data (which does not identify individuals) for analytical purposes.</p>

        <h2>3. Data Quality (APP 10)</h2>
        <p>While we record the information you provide, we rely on you and your device to provide accurate location and timestamp data. We take no responsibility for the accuracy of user-submitted information, including location, comments, or trolley details.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Security (APP 11)</h2>
        <p>We take reasonable steps to protect the information we hold from misuse, interference, loss, and unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure. Data is stored in a JSON file on the web server. However, no internet transmission or electronic storage method is 100% secure. Access to server logs containing IP addresses is restricted.</p>

        <h2>5. Access and Correction (APP 12 & 13)</h2>
        <p>The information submitted via the Service is intended to be publicly logged. Given the nature of the Service and the public display of logs, direct access to or correction of specific log entries by users is generally not provided through an automated interface.</p>
        <p>If you have submitted information that you believe is incorrect or contains sensitive personal details you wish to have removed, please contact us using the details below. We will assess requests on a case-by-case basis, but removal may not always be feasible or immediate.</p>
        <p>You generally cannot access the IP address information we hold as it is used for security purposes.</p>

        <h2>6. Anonymity (APP 2)</h2>
        <p>While you do not need to provide your name or contact details to use the Service, please be aware that the combination of location data, timestamp, and potentially comments, along with the logging of your IP address, means your submissions are not entirely anonymous.</p>

        <h2>7. Cookies</h2>
        <p>We may use browser cookies to manage submission frequency and prevent abuse. These cookies store non-personally identifiable information related to submission counts and timestamps on your device. You can manage cookie preferences through your browser settings, but disabling cookies may affect your ability to submit reports if rate limiting is active.</p>

        <h2>8. Cross-border Disclosure</h2>
        <p>We do not typically disclose personal information overseas. However, the web server hosting the Service may be located outside Australia. By using the Service, you acknowledge that your information may be stored on servers located outside Australia.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date. You are advised to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.</p>

        <h2>10. Complaints and Contact Information</h2>
        <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, wish to make an access/correction request, or have a complaint about our handling of your personal information, please contact us:</p>
        <div class="contact-info">
            info@sandgroper.net
        </div>
        <p>If you are not satisfied with our response to a complaint, you may be able to lodge a complaint with the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC).</p>
